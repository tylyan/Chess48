# CHESS PROJECT#
by Yuk Yan and Juan Morales 

A fully functioning game of Chess playable in the console written in Java.

The project was written around the Object-Oriented Programming design pattern.  For example, Piece is an abstract class with standard methods that a piece would have and the specific Chess pieces extended the abstract Piece class in order to keep the code DRY.
